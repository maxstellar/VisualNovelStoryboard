Generally, stick to a linear flow (minimal choice diversion)

Game Idea: You play as Connor, an aerospace engineer fresh out of college returning to his childhood hometown for a fresh start at a newly built lab. Upon returning, he begins hearing a voice in his head, calling out to him. What's stranger is that--it seems to be saying only a single word: "Remember." Fed up with the distraction, he takes matters into his own hands and sets out to find whatever it is that he's meant to "remember," retrieving an old box of Polaroids to guide him. As he starts to recount his childhood memories, pieces of a story that he had lost to time begin to reveal themselves.

One-liner summary/plot: You return to your hometown for a fresh start, but a voice in your head repeating the word “remember” drives you to revisit old Polaroids to uncover pieces of a past you’d long forgotten.

- "Remember"
- Journey through the past / revisiting old places and people he once knew
- As he goes, he collects memories and pieces together his lost time/life
- Add a polaroid gimmick?
    - Menu that shows different polaroids
        - Guide picture, to help you find an object (point and click concept)
        - Unlocked memories (guide pictures of which their object has already been found)
    - UI can be polaroid themed / mixed with star theme
    - First polaroid you start with can be a picture of the starry sky (one you took with Lily)
