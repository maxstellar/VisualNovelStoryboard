# Connor
## Description
Connor is a 23-year-old aerospace engineer who has clung to his childhood dream with the belief that achieving it would make him feel whole--only to discover that success has left him hollow.
After graduating from a top university with a degree in aerospace / mechanical engineering, he is recruited by a newly established, privately funded aerospace lab, drawing him back to the hometown where he went to middle school. The streets that were once his to explore now feel unfamiliar, heavy with something he can’t quite name.
## Appearance
Connor has gray-sapphire eyes with permanent shadows beneath them--although they have become fainter as a result of graduating and a healing sleep schedule. His dirty-blonde hair is perpetually unkempt, as he never quite learned how to care for himself beyond the bare minimum.
## Traits
- Hard worker
  - When given a clear objective and external validation, Connor is relentless. 
- Intellectually curious
  - He is fascinated by systems, physics, and space, but often ignores the emotional or human implications of his work. Lily filled this role for him when they were best friends.
## Flaws
- Driven by others
  - Motivation stems not from himself, but from his mother's vision for his future, in Lily's dreams, and the approval of his peers.
- Blinded by goals
  - Views life as a sequence of milestones or goals to complete, believing meaning lies just beyond the next achievement
  - Narrows his world into work and progression, leaving little room to live in the present
- Fundamentally avoidant
  - Chooses to avoid rather than confront, hiding from difficult conversations, burying himself in work rather than processing his emotions
  - As a kid, moving around often, he learns that it's best always moving forward; forget the old, adapt to the new, succeed, never linger
  - Moving a lot was tough. He never kept any friends for more than a year or so, depriving him of deep bonds and relationships. When promised that this hometown would be the last time they moved, he finally found a friend in Lily who he could keep.
  - When he is forced to move again, threatening his bond and friendship with Lily, he is reluctant to tell her, delaying it, hoping that it will solve itself over time
  - It doesn't, and his worst fear is confirmed: honesty is met with pain and loss. -> he hides from emotion and feeling with avoidance
  - This prevents him from creating or maintaining meaningful relationships with anyone in the future.
  - Avoid telling the player that he is avoidant. Show it through patterns

# Lily

Up to art team!
## Traits
