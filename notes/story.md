# Past Story
**Scene 1:**
It is barely getting dark outside and Connor is looking through his telescope. Enter Lily, who asks Connor why he is looking through a telescope at such an early hour, to which Connor explains that there are still a lot of things to see in the sky during the day. They hit it off and become best friends because they are both fascinated with space and the night sky.

**Scene 2:**
Later, they bond over (something. a partial eclipse on March 25th? CHANGE) Lily comments on how cool the experience is and says that she wants to become an astronomer when she grows up, and Connor echoes her. They vow to both become astronomers together.

(MORE SCENES CAN BE ADDED, TO SHOW BONDING AND TIME SPENT TOGETHER)
(Originally, scenes are so scarce because it is a short film. This ambitious VN will not skimp on scenes.)

**Scene 3:**
Connor is in his room when his mom comes in and talks to him about how they are moving to another state so he can study at a prestigious private school. Connor pushes back against this idea, but his mom won’t budge and mentions that they have better resources to study astronomy. Connor still dislikes the idea.

**Scene 4:**
Connor tries to subtly drop the news to Lily on the day he is supposed to leave, but it does not go down well. Lily gets upset and Connor leaves on a low note for the two.
"I leave today." "...what?"

**Scene 5 (did not happen in reality? Maybe it did?):**
Connor is about to leave, and the two see each other for the last time. They look at each other from afar, and run towards each other, with open arms, forgiving.

# Future Story
He remembers!
Connor rushes through the town, seeing all of the people he met greet him as he runs by (depending on his relationship with them from the story). He has to get back to their meeting spot.
Lily sits there, reminiscing. "I was hoping you would remember."
