# INTRO CUTSCENE

#### INT. DREAM - NIGHT
Two shadowy figures loom over Connor, facing away from him as he lies on the ground.
Connor looks down, to see his own hands, blurry. (Hands may look wrong in lucid dreams.)

**LILY'S FRIEND**
So... he's back in town?

**DREAM LILY**
He's been for the past few days, I heard.

**LILY'S FRIEND**
Well... what are you going to do?

**DREAM LILY**
Nothing. I doubt he even remember- (s who I am.)

The sound of a loud alarm clock drowns out the rest of their conversation, as the pitch black of the dream is replaced with the color of the sun hitting the inside of Connor's eyelids.

#### INT. CONNOR'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING
Connor hits his head on the headboard of his bed as he awakens.

**CONNOR**
OW!

As Connor goes to turn off his alarm, a voice speaks to him.

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
Good, you're up.

# CUTSCENE END
# INTRO SEQUENCE

**CONNOR**
Well- \*yawn* Good morning to you too, [name].

**NARRATOR**
[name] begins to speak, but the sound of their voice is drowned out by a ringing in your ears.

A large piece of text reads "REMEMBER" on the screen as the background fades to black, and a voice can be heard saying, "Remember."

The black fades back to where we were before.

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
...eggs got cold and you don't even care! / ...what are you- Are you good?

**CONNOR**
I-I'm fine. / Just... got up too quickly, I think.

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
Well, then, did you hear anything I just said?

**CONNOR**
You were talking about...

### **CHOICE**
#### [Eggs]

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
...I'm baffled that *that's* what you're focusing on. / It's not about the eggs, Connor.

#### [My attitude]

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
Oh, so you can listen, and you've just been purposefully not doing so for the last few days?

#### [Space]

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
It's always about space with you. Is that what you've been daydreaming about?

#### CHOICE END

**GUIDE CHARACTER (CONT'D)**
*sighs* Well, it doesn't matter. The point is, you really have got to lock in, man. / Your new job starts tomorrow and you're spacing out on me every few seconds!
