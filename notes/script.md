# INTRO CUTSCENE

#### INT. DREAM - NIGHT
Two shadowy figures loom over Connor, whose point of view has them facing away from him, as he lies on the ground.
Connor looks down, to see his own hands, blurry. (Hands may look wrong in lucid dreams.)

**LILY'S FRIEND**
So he's back in town?

**DREAM LILY**
For the next few days, I heard.

**LILY'S FRIEND**
Well... what are you going to do?

**DREAM LILY**
Nothing. I doubt he even remember-

The sound of a loud alarm clock drowns out the rest of their conversation, as the pitch black of the dream is replaced with the color of the sun hitting the inside of Connor's eyelids.

#### INT. CONNOR'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING
Connor hits his head on the headboard of his bed as he awakens.

**CONNOR**
OW!

As Connor goes to turn off his alarm, a voice speaks to him.

**GUIDE CHARACTER**
Good, you're up.

# CUTSCENE END

**CONNOR**
Good morning to you too.
